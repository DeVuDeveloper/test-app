Digital Bakery is a modern web application built using Rails, React, and Vite, showcasing the seamless integration of client-side development with the power of server-side rendering. The application is designed to simulate the experience of running a bakery, where users can place and fulfill orders for digital cookies.

## Features

- **Real-time Baking Progress:** Witness the magic of modern web technologies with Hotwire, Stimulus, and Vite. The application showcases the dynamic nature of baking, allowing you to experience the entire process in real-time as the cookies go through preparation, baking, and fulfillment. Thanks to Turbo Streams and Turbo Frames, only the relevant parts of the page update, providing a fluid user experience.

- **Order Management:** React comes into play for managing orders. The Orders section allows you to view, sort, and track the status of each order. You'll know exactly when an order is in progress or has been fulfilled, enhancing your bakery management experience.
